PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Svati is an innovative music marketplace that leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to allow users to buy, collect, and resell songs. The platform is being built using Next.js for the front-end, with web3 helpers such as Wagmi, Ethers, Chakra UI, and Rainbowkit, while the backend utilizes Nest.js to call the APIs. Furthermore, four smart contracts have been developed using Solidity, including the Artist contract, Factory contract, Collection contract, and Marketplace contract, which use helper packages such as OpenZeppelin ERC1155 standard.

The platform offers a unique experience for both artists and music enthusiasts. Artists can sign up on Svati to upload their albums and add items (songs) to their collection, which can be sold as NFTs on the marketplace. Users can listen to, buy, collect, and resell these NFTs, as well as vote for their favorite artists in governance-related matters.

Svati offers a novel approach to music distribution that is secure, decentralized, and transparent, thanks to the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts. By utilizing NFTs, the platform offers a new way for artists to monetize their music and engage with their fans. Meanwhile, music enthusiasts can discover new music and collect unique digital assets that hold value and can be resold on the marketplace.
